                        It provides the structure and layout of content on the internet, using tags to define elements such as headings,
                         paragraphs, images, and links.

                    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style the appearance of HTML elements on web pages. It enables

                <br>
                <p>As I kid I always loved computers. I have always been intrigued by them. I always played video games on them
                    over the choice of a console. My first interest was in computer hardware and how to make my video games run faster.
                    Eventually, I became interested in computer softwares and how to program. I took my first step in 8th grade to learn
                    python and build a number guessing game.

            <h3>My Progression,</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In high school I took two introduction programming class which taught the basics of python. Now as a soon to be college sophomore,
                I have taken another two inroduction programming class that taught C#. These classes were a huge step towards my aspired career,
                a software developer. These classed both taught fundamental programming concepts and how I can use them in each language.
            </p>
            <p>
                As well as on my own freetime, I have picked up a online course that teaches me the languages used for website development. These
                languages include: HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, jQuery, NoSQL, SQL, and many more. Those are the only ones I have reached but I'm
                excited to learn more!
